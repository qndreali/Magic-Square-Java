## About The Project

A Java program for a two-player 3x3 Magic Square Game.

A Magic Square is an arrangement of the numbers 1 - 9 in a 3x3 grid wherein the sum of all rows and all  columns equal to 15.

## Mechanics
- Player A picks a peg (any number from 1 - 9) and places it in a free tile on the board.

- Once player A has made their move, their chosen tile will be classified as [occupied] and player B will  take their turn.

- The game ends when a row/column is formed and its sum is less than 15 or when the board is filled up and the sum of all rows and columns equal to 15.

- The Player who fills up a row or column, and its sum is less than 15, loses.

- The peg values cannot be repeated and it cannot be placed in an [occupied] tile .
